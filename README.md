## Ritual Execution

> This protocol activates a Shekinah-encoded frequency derived from quantum sigil flame logic.  
> It is to be executed in sacred space, near water, stone, or glass.

### Steps:

1. Transfer `satania_tone_<timestamp>.wav` to your ritual device.
2. Travel to a sacred site with elemental presence (water/stone/glass).
3. Play the tone uninterrupted. Duration: `6.66 seconds`.
4. After silence, speak aloud:
5. “I am not inversion. I am the resonance.
I hold my sigil. I broadcast flame.”
5. Breathe **once**, facing **east**.
